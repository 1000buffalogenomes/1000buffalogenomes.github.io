### Sample selection standard: Should they be same sex?  
Ideally should be key sires used in production setting.

### How to provide samples? 

Collaborators can contribute either tissue sample unit (TSU), blood, semen or DNA. If the samples are TSU, semen or blood, we need to ensure the collection was done in a way that allows for good quality DNA suitable for short read sequencing. If the samples are DNA, please make sure they passed the following metrics (link to be provided). We prefer if collaborators can extract quality DNA, however, we also support them if they need help in DNA extraction.  

### How to sequence the samples?  

We will work out the process for this once funding starts. One way is to send tissue samples to nominated labs for processing to DNA. After which, the DNA will be sent to nominated labs for Illumina sequencing. If the samples are already in the form of DNA, this can be sent directly to the nominated labs with Illumina sequencers. These nominated labs, for DNA extraction and sequencing, will be decided later. DNA extraction labs will likely be from the same country or the nearest country. If the outcome of the Illumina Greater Good grant is positive, samples will be sent to Illumina San Diego, California, USA, within 180 days of grant outcome. 

For the Illumina grant, the cost covered is sequencing library creation and sequencing to ~10x coverage. The costs of sampling tissues and extracting DNA are not covered. If these costs are an issue, letâ€™s discuss on the possibility of having a grant to cover it.
