Filipino farmers rely on carabaos for their draft power and preferability in transporting crops in lumpy farmlands. The Philippines is estimated to have 2.78 million carabaos in  the half of 2022 - a 2.46% decrease from inventory last year. For these developing agricultural country, the carabao is an important livestock that aids smallhold farmers for their livelihoods. In addition to draft power, this animal is also utilized in its milk, meat, and hide production: an alternative source of income besides its use in rice and corn farming. However, as modernization is increasingly becoming popular due to its efficiency, the Philippine carabao may decline in purpose, and production of this animal is expected to shrink. On the other hand, suppose the utility of this animal is maximized through genetic improvement without neglecting the native genetic pools, especially in milk and meat production together with its resiliency in hot and humid climates, then propagation and conservation of the Philippine carabao will follow, which then contributes to reinforcing food security while escalating the livelihood of Filipino farmers.
