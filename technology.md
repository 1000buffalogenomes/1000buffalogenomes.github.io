These are some of the research and technologies that can be developed from the generation of SNP database for water-buffaloes:

- **Design of inclusive or breed/trait spicific SNP chips**\
    The availability of genetic variants of different and each buffalo population will help in the design and creation of SNP panels or low-pass WGS capture inclusive to all types or specific to the breed/trait of interest

- **Development of breed specific assembly**\
    While this project will only utilise short-reads sequences, these data will still be useful for assembly evaluation or polishing if the collaborator wish to assemble their own buffalo breed's genome using long-read sequences.

- **Molecular delineation of river- and swamp-type buffaloes**\
    The river- and swamp-type buffaloes are still regarded as same species, and its subspecies category has not been recognise officially despite its difference in chromosome number and molecular divergence. Genetic variations between the two can strengthen the claim in proposing the two-types as different subspecies of the *Bubalus bubalis* or water buffalo.

- **Establishment of water buffalo pangenome and creation of a buffalo genome graph**\
    Short-read sequences can help test pangenome graphs in its accuracy in genome alignment with different breeds.
    It is beneficial for the community to have a collated dataset given the rise of different genome assemblies and the advantage of using pangenome graphs as a reference assembly rather than the conventional linear genome.
