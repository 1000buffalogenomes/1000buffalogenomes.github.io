These are some of the research and technologies that can be developed from the generation of SNP database for water-buffaloes

- Design of inclusive or breed/trait spicific SNP chips
- Development of breed specific assembly
- Molecular delineation of river- and swamp-type buffaloes
- Establishment of water buffalo pangenome and creation of a buffalo genome graph

<some information how this sequencing information may help in developing breed specific assembly ,pangenome and genome graph>
