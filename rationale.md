What we envision in this project is a beneficial collaborations within the water buffalo research community with harmonise objectives toward escalating genetic improvement and conservation of this animal. To continue the community's venture in buffalo research, we are laying out a large-scale project to discover SNPs from different buffalo population, open and accessible for everyone, thereby into an inclusive creation of technologies to upgrade the water buffaloes, especially for countries who do not have enough support or resources to sequence or genotype their own animals. While this project will only aim to sequence buffaloes across the world and discover SNPS, its vision is to boost buffalo genomic research and enhance the animals with technologies and developments that will branch out from this study. Ultimately, to maximise the production potential of this animal, a sustainable and efficient farming, uplift livelihoods of our farmers while contributing towards food security and genetic conservation in the face of climate change and agricultural industrialisation.

### The water-buffaloes as a source of milk, meat, hide and draft-power

The water buffalo is a significant livestock for milk, meat and draft power in Asia. There are two types, the river- and swamp-type which differs in chromosome number, utility and geographical location; more diverse than the *Bos taurus* and *Bos indicus* sub-species. Intensive breeding development of these animals, especially the river-type, are implemented in countries such as India, Pakistan, Italy, Brazil, China and the Philippines.

### Genomic Research and Genetic Improvement
<!-- How sequence analysis and SNP chip is important- for selective breeding, parentage, optimal mating, and diversity and conservation applications -->

Advancement in genome sequencing such as the Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and Third-Generation Sequencing (TGS) has pushed forward high-throughput and large genomic sequencing to be faster and cheaper than it is 10 years ago. Genome researches for buffaloes are still few compared to other livestock animals such as cattle and sheep; wherein genome studies for these animals already started as early as 2004. While other ruminant species are moving towards whole genome sequencing and targeted/low-pass sequencing for genotyping, the water buffalo still only have 5 chromosome-level genome assembly in the public databases and one SNP panel designed using a cattle reference genome. Nonetheless, this SNP panel is widely used for GWAS and genotyping since it is the only existing high density SNP panel commercially available for this animal.

The impact of genomic research for 5 breeds of cattle in the United States has greatly increased their economic value which led to double profitability for the last 10 years.  For instance, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has invested approximately $100 million for their cattle research in the last decade, and the calculated return of investment is at about $4 billion which will accumulate throughout the year due to gradual increase of genetic gains for the animal <!-- (Rexroad et al., 2019) -->. Creation of technologies that incorporates genomic research and genetic selection in livestock management will greatly improve and boost the animalâ€™s productivity. Although genome research will be quite expensive for smaller population as the research cost will be higher per animal basis (such as the water buffaloes as a large percentage of this animal are reared by small holders), the lifetime merit of increased genetics on economic traits of an animal throughout its generation will accumulatively influence increased livelihood and profits <!-- (Biscarini et al., 2015; Pineda et al., 2021; Rexroad et al., 2019) -->.

Incorporation of genomic selection in breeding programs has proved to be an advantageous strategy in accelerating reproduction schemes and increasing genetic gains of the livestock animals <!--(Dekkers, 2012; Xu et al., 2020)-->. Whole-genome selection (e.g., use of SNP panel for animal genotyping) pushes genetic improvement forward which enabled a progressive approach in livestock rearing from breeding selection of economic traits like meat and milk production to disease resistance and improved animal health <!-- (Miller, 2010; Womack, 2005) -->.

If this has been done in cattle and continually progressing, the water buffaloes can join the trend for an efficient and sustainable farming.

### Conservation and Biodiversity

While the advantage of selective breeding is to improve the production efficiency of an animal, it also contributes, however, to homogeneity of the population because of bull selections and artificial insemination. It might also introduce non-native genetics to a native population, thus losing the purity of a possibly conserved breed. It is essential to look into the genetic structures of the water buffalo population before the implementation of wide-scale genetic improvement to avoid mixing up the genetics of a native and imported animals/clusters. To parallelised genetic improvement with conservation, it is important to identify each population clusters for biodiversity and preservation.

### Climate change and food security

The water buffalo is known as a "hardy animal" for its ability to thrive in poor pastures and tropical areas due to their wallowing behavior. It converts low-quality roughages into high quality milk and meat because of it's specialised traits such as large rumen capacity and unique microflora, which also makes it digest higher than cattle. Moreover, it also has higher resistance to foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and brucellosis. Some farmers are raising water buffalo as an alternative with cattle farming because of these specialised traits on top of its high milk fat and total solids content.

With global warming becoming more apparent in recent years and the continuos increase of human population and demand for nutrition, the water buffalo may play an important role as a source of milk and meat that thrives in hot and humid climate. Or if neglected, a possible decrease of this animal and endangerment or loss of rare native breeds.
