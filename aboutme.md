The 1000 Buffalo Genomes Project is initiated by Dr. Wai Yee Low (Lloyd Low) from University of Adelaide who also assembled the first [buffalo reference genome](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-08260-0) as well as other [bovine reference genomes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15848-y). 

This project is still at its conceptualisation stage and we’re still looking for collaborators to contribute to the 1000 buffalo genomes. If you already have SNPs data, you can directly contribute to this project. The genomes will be made up of both river and swamp buffalo including some conservation breeds. We’re planning to apply to Illumina’s Agricultural Greater Good Initiative with prize amounting up to $350,000 that allows for up to 1000 samples. Organising a consortium or group of researchers from multiple countries/organisations will strengthen the chance of winning this grant. Our efforts here, even if not funded by Illumina, can also potentially attract other fundings.

### Goals
- Organise research groups and harmonise our project direction for the water buffaloes
- Discover SNPs from 1000 water-buffalo samples
- Design technologies for genetic improvement and conservation
- Open-source data to be used for subsequent studies

### Data Ownership
<div style="text-align: justify">
We would like to expand genome research in water buffaloes to fully utilise the potential of this animal in milk, meat, hide and draft power as well as for conservation purposes, hence there will be transparency in code and SNP data, and data generated in this project will be released to the public.

In short, data will be open-source.

### Our vision
<div style="text-align: justify">
Continued collaborations of the International Water Buffalo consortium and availability of SNP data for improved genetics of water buffaloes and conservation of its different populations.
