This project is still at its conceptualisation stage and we are actively looking for collaborators to contribute to the 1000 buffalo genomes. Below is a list of our current collaborators. If you already have sequenced data, you can directly contribute to this project. The samples will be made up of both swamp and river buffalo including some conservation breeds. We are applying for Illumina’s Agricultural Greater Good Initiative with prize amounting up to $350,000 that allows for up to 1000 samples.

The 1000 Buffalo Genomes Project is a collaboration of various organisations and research group with the goal of sequencing different swamp- and river-type buffalo populations.

### Goals
- Organise research groups and harmonise our project direction for the water buffaloes
- Discover SNPs from 1000 water-buffalo samples
- SNP array panel and low pass WGS + SNP capture
- Design methods for genetic improvement and conservation
- Sequencing data will be made publicly available

### Data ownership
<div style="text-align: justify">
We would like to expand genome research in water buffaloes to fully utilise the potential of this animal in milk, meat, hide and draft power as well as for conservation purposes, hence there will be transparency in code and SNP data, and data generated in this project will be released to the public.

In short, data will be open-source.
</div>

### Our vision
<div style="text-align: justify">
Continued collaborations with the International Water Buffalo consortium and availability of SNP data for genetic improvement and conservation of the water buffaloes.
