The project is at its conceptualisation stage and we welcome you to join the 1000 Buffalo Genomes Project. Below is a list of our current collaborators. If you already have sequenced data, you can directly contribute to this project. The samples will be made up of both swamp- and river-type buffalo including some conservation breeds. We are applying for the Illumina’s Agricultural Greater Good Initiative with prize amounting up to $350,000 that allows for up to 1000 samples. We will also submit this project for other funding opportunities.

### Goals

- provide genetics information of buffalo populations worldwide to establish the foundational resources needed to utilize genomic prediction tools to breed more productive buffalo.
- inform population and conservation genetics studies of buffalo
- provide insights into domestication and adaption traits
- uncover recessive lethal mutations
- serve as reference imputation panel
