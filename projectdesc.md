### Conceptual framework

- 50% swamp, 50% river type (with conservation breeds)
- 1000 buffaloes across the world
- voluntary submissions
- minimum of 50 samples each contributions (but it's just the ideal)

Sequencing data will be used for:
- SNP discovery
- population structure analysis
- a reference population for imputing from SNP genotypes
- verification of a pangenome graph (selected few only)
