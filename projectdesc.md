### Conceptual framework

#### Animal selection and sample collection

- Ideally, 50% of the total samples would be from swamp-type and 50% from river-type, with conservation breeds included.
- Target total number of samples would be 1000 water buffaloes across the world.
- Minimum of 30 samples from each contributor (can be less for conservation breeds).
- Sample collection (blood, tissue or semen), DNA extraction and shipping of samples will potentially be at the collaborator's own expense.

#### Data storage and analysis

- We are partnering with Oracle Australia to implement cloud storage and analysis. A dedicated SNP calling pipeline will be implemented.

#### Reference genome
- We are currently assembling the Philippine carabao (swamp-type) that we can use as reference for this species.For the river-type, we can use the [UOA_WB_1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_003121395.1). There are other water buffalo assemblies that we can explore too. See [Data](https://1000buffalogenomes.github.io/datamgmt/) for the available genome assemblies.
