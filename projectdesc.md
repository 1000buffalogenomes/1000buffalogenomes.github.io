### Conceptual framework

#### Animal selection and sample collection

- Ideally, 50% of the total samples would be from swamp-type and 50% from river-type, with conservation breeds included.
- Target total number of samples would be 1000 water buffaloes across the world.
- Minimum of 50 samples from each contributors. If you think you do not have enough animals in your area, do not hesitate to contact us since we would like to include breeds for conservation as well.
- Sample collection (blood, tissue or semen), DNA extraction and shipping will be at the collaborator's own expense. Only the library prep and sequencing kit / sequencing service will be given grant. 

#### Data storage and analysis

- The data will be uploaded on a cloud storage or sent through a harddrive at the University of Adelaide.

Sequencing data will be used for:
- SNP discovery
- population structure analysis
- serves as reference population for imputation of SNP genotypes to WGS
- verification of a pangenome graph (selected few only)
